		     		<p style="color:white">In May this year, I finished a multidisciplinary master's program with a hands-on approach in an international atmosphere. This master provided me economic insights, managements skills and taught me the challenges of international business. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to cooperate with fellow students from all over the world. Additionally, by living in Paris as well as following a French course, my French improved significantly. This way, I am even more prepared and exited to enter the job market.</p><br>

Besides gaining insight in specific medical solutions, I developed a general critical mind to solve all kinds of engineering problems. I obtained fluent english language skills by pursuing courses in English for which it was required to write scientific reports and a dissertation.

			<h6>Tour Guide in Paris</h6>
			<p> <br>- Since 2019 -<br><br>
			Guiding tourists around the city by bike while telling historical and cultural stories in a pleasant way. <br>I adapt my story and level of interaction to the atmosphere of the group. A group consisting of families with kids requires a different approach from a group with only adults. In my free time, I search for extra information about monuments or temporary events to keep up to date and to keep my story interesting.

			<h6>Volunteer @ Engineers without Borders</h6>
			<p> <br>- Since 2018 -<br><br>
				Aiding disadvantaged communities to improve their quality of life through education and implementation of sustainable engineering projects.<br><br>
				I am currently involved in a project on waste management in Banjul (Gambia). Last year my collegues and I went on a mission to Banjul to cooperate with the city council and get a better understanding of their needs. After uncovering the main issues, we developed several feasible and sustainable solutions that will be implemented in the near future.

			<h6>Logistic worker @ Hospital</h6>
			<p> <br>- 2015 -<br><br>
				During the summer of 2015, I pursued a student job at the hospital in my hometown. I was in charge of sterilizing the surgical tools and controlling the equipment inventory for the operation rooms. By working here, I came in close contact with the surgeons and nursery staff and gained many insights on how surgeries are performed. During this experience, I became passionate about the medical industry and its possibilities to aid people and as a result, I decided to specify my masters in Biomedical Engineering.<br><br>

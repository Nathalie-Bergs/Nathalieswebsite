				Dear Sir/Madam, <br><br><br>
				Through this page, I want to express my motivation to join Emerton I am a <strong>people-lover</strong> with a <strong>problem-solving mind</strong>, ready to launch my professional journey. Fascinated about how the digital era is changing each industry, I am eager to be part of this new way of approaching challenges. <br><br>

				With an academic background in Biomedical Engineering, I developed a strong analytical mind and learned to not avoid highly complex situations but rather tackle them with critical and logical thinking. I am a very <strong>dedicated</strong> person and I am <strong>not afraid to work hard</strong> in order to reach an objective. As a matter of fact, during my master, my fellow-student and I worked on a project where we had to design a not yet existing machine for making pills that would fit on a pharmacist’s desk. We paid close attention to the many requirements and constraints that were posed and took them into consideration during our intense brainstorm sessions. Afterwards, during the realization of our final idea, we often worked until late in the evening to reach our objectives. This project helped me to improve my organization and time management skills. Furthermore, I strongly believe that by working together and combining skills, you can achieve more and therefore am a true <strong>team player</strong> and a <strong>careful listener</strong>. <br><br>

				My natural <strong>curiosity</strong> and <strong>hunger for learning</strong> new subjects, led me to pursue a masters’ in International Business, in which I got familiar with many disciplines of business. Corporate strategy, project management, accounting as well as people management, time management and many more, are now part of my skills set. Within an aspiring <strong>multinational environment</strong>, I learned to put knowledge into practice and gained insight in many different global markets. Furthermore, over the years, I refined my <strong>English</strong> and by living in Paris, I improved my <strong>French</strong>. As a result, I now speak both languages fluently. Having finished my master’s in International Business, I am now more than ready to deploy the knowledge I have acquired into practice and grow both professionally and personally. <br><br>

				As a fresh graduate who is looking for a consulting opportunity in Paris, Emerton caught my eye because of its <strong>innovative approach</strong> as well as the <strong>positive and stimulating atmosphere</strong> the company creates for its employees. The <strong>fact-based and hands-on approach</strong> of Emerton are well in line with my way of solving problems. Next, I was very pleased to see Emerton’s overall high score of 4,5 out of 5 on Vault, which proves its growing perspective and <strong>effective approach</strong> of working. <br><br>

				I want to join an <strong>international firm</strong> that would expose me to many different experiences, and I am convinced that Emerton is a great workplace for this. Additionally, I find it exciting to <strong>help clients</strong> improve and/or transform their business to make better decisions. To this extent, a position as a strategy associate consultant intern would be a wonderful experience to put into practice everything I studied over the last years in an environment that seems to me particularly <strong>stimulating</strong> and full of <strong>challenges</strong>. <br><br>

				Hoping to have expressed my enthusiasm and I look forward to hearing from you. <br><br><br>


				Warm regards, <br>
				Nathalie Bergs
